The reason they are widely used is that main is the default name for the starting branch when running git init and origin is the default name for the remote repository when running git clone.\nGit stores a single file as a blob, which is a backronym for binary large object and is a collection of binary data. It can store any type of data including multimedia files and images. Blobs in the git object database are stored named with a SHA-1 hash key of their content and containing the exact same content as the file would on my filesystem.\nInteracting with remotes A remote repository is a version of the project that’s hosted on a server, in my case always on GitHub. The default name Git assigns to the remote when I clone it is origin. (Technically, the remote could also be hosted on my machine but in a separate location from my working copy.)\ngit fetch \u0026lt;remote\u0026gt; downloads all new objects from the remote repository (e.g. including references to new branches) but does not automatically merge these objects into my local work. git pull fetches and automatically merges the remote version of the local branch I’m currently on and merges it if the current branch is set up to track the remote. By default, git clone sets up my local main branch to track the remote version, named origin/main.\nTo share work with the remote, I can use git push \u0026lt;remote\u0026gt; \u0026lt;branch\u0026gt; (e.g. to share work from my local main branch with origin/main, I can do git push origin main).\nUndoing things Cardinal rule: don’t push stuff before you’re fully happy with it. Changing your local history is easy, changing the history on the server isn’t.\nChanging message of last commit: (with an empty index) run git commit --amend.\nChanging the content of the last commit: stage changes you want to add, then run git commit --amend. If you don’t want to change the commit message, append --no-edit.\nUnstaging a staged file: git restore --staged \u0026lt;pathspec\u0026gt;.\nUndoing changes in the working directory and reverting a file to its state after the last commit: git restore \u0026lt;pathspec\u0026gt;.\nChanging multiple commits (edit, reorder, squash, delete, split, etc.): git rebase -i HEAD~#, where # is the parent of the last commit you want to edit (e.g. if you want to edit the last 3 commits, HEAD~3 will select commits HEAD, HEAD~1, and HEAD~2). More in docs\nI’ve accidentally overwritten a file with content I meant to place in a new file, and now want to 1) save the new content under a different name and 2) restore the file I’ve overwritten. Solution: Just save the new content under a new name (temporarily deleting the file I’ve accidentally overwritten, and then use git restore \u0026lt;name_of_overwritten_file\u0026gt; to restore the old version of the overwritten file.\nI’ve deleted one or more commits (e.g. by using a hard reset) that I need to recover. First thing to try: run git reflog to get a log of commits HEAD pointed to. Once I’ve identified the commit I need (ab1af) I can create a new branch that points to it using git branch recover-branch ab1af. If there is no reflog, I can run git fsck --full to check the database for integrity and get a list of objects that aren’t reacheable. The commit I’m looking for will be labelled with dangling commit, and I can create a branch pointing to it.\nRemoving a file from every commit (e.g. accidentally committed large data file): git filter-branch --index-filter \u0026#39;rm --ignore-unmatch --cached data.csv\u0026#39; HEAD.

None of these hold in practice, but the model is extremely useful because it captures the essence of algorithm behaviour while being very simple to work with.\nBest, worst, and average-case complexity are functions defined by the minimum, maximum, and average number of steps taken for any instance of size n of the input string. (Think about a graph with n on the x-axis and number of steps on the y-axis, with number of steps for each instance of a problem of size n forming columns of dots with increasing variation as n – and thus the number of possible instances – increases. The three functions trace the lowest, highest, and middle dots at each input size n. See Fig 2.1 in ADM.)\nUsing these functions to analyse algorithms is impractical, however, because they are not smooth and require lots of detail about the algorithm and its implementation.\nBig O notation ignores such details and focuses on the essentials to capture the rate at which runtime (or space requirements) grow as a function of the input size (the letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also called its order). In essence, this means only focusing on the higest order term and ignoring constants (which depend on things like hardware and programming language used to run the algorithm).\nA function $f(n)$ is $O(g(n))$ if there exist constants $c$ and $n_0$ such that $f(n) \\leq cg(n)$ for any $n \u0026gt; n_0$. Intuitively, this means that $f(n)$ grows no faster than $cg(n)$ above a certain input size. For example: $T(n) = 2n^2 + 3n$ is $O(n^2)$, since $5n^2 \\geq 2n^2 + 3n$ for all positive values of $n$.\nAmortised worse-case complexity takes into account that the running time of a given operation in an algorithm may take a very long or a very short time depending on the situation, and averages those different running times of the operation in a sequence over that sequence. Adding an element to an array that is dynamically resized takes $O(1)$ time until the array is full, when the array needs to create a new array of twice its original size, copy all elements over to the new array, and add the new element, which takes $O(n)$ time. Average worst-case complexity averages these runtimes to find that pushing elements onto a dynamically resized array takes: $\\frac{nO(1) + O(n)}{n + 1} = O(1)$, constant time. (Source)\nExercises:\nIs $2^{n+1} = O(2^n)$?\nIs $(x + y)^2 = O(x^2 + y^2)$?\nWhat’s the time complexity of $f(n) = min(n, 100)$?\nSolutions:\nThe way to go is to start from the definition. The statement is true if there is a $c$ and $n_0$ for which $c2^n \\geq 2^{n+1}$ for $n \u0026gt; n_0$. The key is to rewrite the right hand side to $c2^n \\geq 2 \\times 2^n$, which makes it obvious that the statement holds whenever $c \\geq 2$.\nStarting from the definition, the statement is true if there exist constants $c$ and $n_0$ for which $c(x^2 + y^2) \\geq (x + y)^2$ for $n \u0026gt; n_0$. Expanding the right hand side, we get $c(x^2 + y^2) \\geq x^2 + 2xy + y^2$. Ignoring the middle term, the statement holds for $c = 1$; considering only the middle term, we see that it is largest when $x = y$, in which case the statement holds for $c = 2$. Thus, $3(x^2 + y^2) \\geq (x + y)^2$, so the statement is true.\nI reflexively answered $n$. Thinking for a moment (an embarassingly long one, admittedly), I realised that $n$ here refers not to the length of an array but to a single number. So the operation is $O(1)$.\nSources Steven Skiena, The Algorithm Design Manual (ADM)\nMIT, Big O notation\nWikipedia, Big O notation\n","date":1637452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637452800,"objectID":"71325568208e87e1442c6426dbe67970","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/algorithm-complexity-analysis/","publishdate":"2021-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/algorithm-complexity-analysis/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["cs"],"title":"Algorithm complexity analysis","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My regular expression cheatsheet, focused on the Python engine. A lot of content is heavily based on (and often shamelessly copied from) the amazing RexEgg and Regular-Expressions.info sites.\nBasics A regex is a text string that a regex engine uses to find text or positions in a body of text, typically for the purposes of validating, finding, replacing, and splitting.\nTo differentiate between the string that makes up the regex and the string that is being searched, the former is often called regex or pattern and the latter string or subject.\nA (lexical) token is a string with an assigned and thus identified meaning (more here). For instance, the token \\w in a pattern stands for a word-character, and will be replaced by that when the engine parses the string.\nThe Python regex engine (and all other modern engines) is regex-directed: it attempts all possible permutations of the regex at a character position of the subject before moving on to the next character (which can involve lots of backtracking). In contrast, text-directed engines visit each character in the subject text only once. This makes them faster but also less powerful.\nA regex engine is eager: it scans alternatives in the regex from left to right and returns the first possible match – Jane|Janet would return Jane as a match in Janet is tall.\nCharacters There are four types of characters: literal characters (e.g. a), metacharacters (^), non-printable characters (\\n), and shorthand character classes (\\w).\nLiteral characters simply match themselves: the single literal character a matches the first a in the string, the sequence of literal characters cat the first occurrence of cat.\nMetacharacters are the twelve punctuation characters from the ACSII table that make regex work its magic: $, (, ), *, +, ., ?, [, \\, ^, {, |. To match metacharacters as literals, escape them with a backslash, as in 1\\+2=3. Exceptions are { and }, which are only treated as metacharacters when part of a quantifier, and ], which only takes on special meaning when part of a character class).\nNon-printable characters or formation marks are characters used to tell word processors how text needs to look and do not appear in printed text.\nShorthand character classes are tokens for certain common character classes.\nNon-printable characters\nCharacter Legend \\r Carriage return \\n Newline \\r\\n Line-break on Windows \\t Tab \\f Form-feed Shorthand character classes\nCharacter Legend \\d Single digit, short for [0-9] \\D Complement of \\d, short for [^\\d] \\w Word character, short for [a-zA-Z\\_] \\W Complement of \\w, short for [^\\w] \\s Whitespace character, short for [\\r\\n\\t\\f\\v ] \\S Complement of \\s, short for [^\\s] \\v Vertical whitespace, short for [\\n\\f\\r] \\V Complement of \\v Character classes Character classes tell the engine to match one of several characters.\nImportantly: [^a-z]u does not mean “u not preceded by a lowercase letter”, but “u preceded by something that isn’t a lowercase letter”. Hence, the pattern doesn’t match a u at the beginning of a string. (In contrast to the ., the negated character class does match invisible line breaks, though, so the above pattern would match the string \\nu.)\nWithin a character class, metacharacters are literals with the exception of ^, -, \\ and ] if they are used in places where they have special meaning: ^ at the beginning, - as part of a range, ] at the end, and \\ to escape another special character or to form a token (i.e. always), and ] at the end. Hence, this regex matches them all as literals: []\\\\-^] (for details on how to includ metacharacters indide character classes without escaping them, see relevant section here here].\nCharacter classes examples\nRegex Match [ab] One of a or b [^ab] Any character that isn’t a or b (incl. newline) [\\w\\s] One word or whitespace character [A-By-z1-2] One of A, B, y, z, 1, 2 [ -~] Any character in the printable section of the ASCII table Exercises:\nMatch gray and grey in London is grey; New York, gray..\nMatch any character that is neither a digit nor a (hidden) line break character.\nWhat does q[^u] match in Iraq and Iraq is a country?\nHow could we match any q not followed by a u?\nSearch for a literal * or +.\nMatch any number greater than 10 made up of all the same digit (e.g. 222, 33, 5555).\nIn b ab cb, match b either at the beginning of the string or when preceded by an a.\nWhat’s the difference between [\\D\\S] and [^\\d\\s]?\nSolutions:\n\\bgr[ae]y\\b. Discussion: need global flag on or use findall() in Python to match both words, otherwise I’ll just get the first one.\n[\\D\\V]. Discussion: the negated character classs matches hidden line break character by default (unlike the .), so need to explicitly exclude them.\nNothing and q . Discussion: the regex means “q followed by something that is not a u”, not “q not followed by a u”, so it requires something to follow the q, and that something to not be a u.

In the default use case, $: make \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt; checks whether filename is out of date and, if so, recompiles it. In the way I use makefiles, $: make \u0026lt;rule\u0026gt; executes a predefined rule to accomplish a certain task like cleaning a particular dataset.\nRules consist of a target (the name of a file to be modified), prerequisites (other files on which the target depends on), and commands to be run in order to update the traget based on changes in the prerequisites.\nA rule tells make when a target is out of date and how to update it. A target is out of date if it doesn’t exist or is older then one of its prerequisite files.\n$: make executes the first specified rule, $: make \u0026lt;rule\u0026gt; executes a particular rule.\nA normal prerequisite makes both an order statement and a dependency statement: the order statement ensures that all commands needed to produce the prerequisete are fully executed before any commands to produce the target, while the dependency statement ensures that the target is updated every time a prerequisite changes. Occasionally, we want a prerequisite to invoke the order without the dependency statement (i.e. target is not udpated when the prerequisite changes, but when target is being updated, then the prerequisite commandas are run first). We can do this by writing the rule as target: normal-prerequisites | order-only-prerequisites.\nmake does its work in two phases: during the read-in phase, it reads the makefile and internalises variables and rules to construct a dependency graph of all targets and their prerequisies; during the target-update phase, it determines what rules to update in what order and executes the commandas to do so.\nAs a result, variable and function expansion can happen either immediately (during the read-in phase) or deferred (after the read-in phase), and gives rise to two flavours of variables: recursively expanded variables, defined by varname = value are expanded at the time the variable is substituted during the target-update phase. Before that point, varname contains the content of value verbatim (e.g. if value is $(othervar), then that last string is the value of varname). In contrast, simply expanded variables, defined by varname := value is expanded immediately when the variable is defined during the read-in phase (and varname would be bound to the value of othervar in the above example).\nTo define a variable containing all csv files in a directory, do csvs := $(wildcard *.csv). The wildcard function is needed here so that the wildcard gets expanded during function creation (as opposed to creating the variable with value *.csv). I could also create a list containing the same files but with a parquet extensions like so: `parqs := $(patsubst %.csv,%.parquet,$(wildcard *.csv)).\nAutomatic variables: $^ is a list of all prerequisites, $@ is the target, $\u0026lt; the first prerequisite.\nIf a target is an action to be performed rather than a file to be updated, then it’s called a phony target. In this case, telling make that we’re using a phone target explicitly by prepending the rule with a line like .PHONY : nameofrule is useful for two reasons: make doesn’t think of a file called nameofrule as the target (which, if it did, would mean that our rule never gets run because it has no prerequisites so that make would think of nameofrule as always up to date) and it doesn’t check for implicit commands to update the target, which improves performance.\nCommands begin with a tab and, unless specified otherwise, are executed by bin/sh. You can set a different shell by changing the value of the SHELL variable (I usually use SHELL := /bin/bash. Each line that begines with a tab and appears within a rule context (anything between the start of one rule and another) is interpreted as a command and sent to the shell.\nThe only thing make does with commands is to check for \\ before newline, and for variables to expand (if you want $ to appear in the command, use $$). To prevent make from echoing a command, prepend it with @.\nPrepend a command with - if you want make to continue regardless of errors. This can be useful for commands like -rm tempfile.csv, where you probaby want to continue even if the file didn’t exist and could thus not be removed.\nBest practices Define a phony target:\n.PHONY: clean clean: rm *.csv Make $: make run all rules:\n.PHONY: all all : rule1 rule2 .PHONY: rule1 rule1: mkdir hello .PHONY: rule2 rule2: rm -rf hello ","date":1629676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629676800,"objectID":"75f908b1f4a0c4ddba1293ed5b324a35","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/makefiles/","publishdate":"2021-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/makefiles/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["tools","cheatsheet"],"title":"Makefiles","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" When people look under the hood, we want them to be impressed by the neatness, consistency, and attention to detail […] If instead they see a scrambled mass of code that looks like it was written by a bevy of drunken sailors, then they are likely to conclude that the same inattention to detail pervades every other aspect of the project. Robert Martin, Clean Code\nDefinitions A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a frequently occuring problem.\nAn idiom is the translation of a design pattern into code using the language clearly and correctly.\nPrinciples Don’t repeat yourself. Collect often used pieces of code in a function of class for reuse. Don’t copy and paste more than once.\nSingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): a class or module should only have a single reason to change – it should be responsible to a single actor that can demand change. Example: an employee class that produces outputs for the finance and HR departments violates the principle, as both the CFO and the CHO might demand changes that then unintenionally affects the output seen by the other. Solution: Separate code that different actors depend on. Corollary: don’t reuse a function for two different outputs just because it does they require the same task, only reuse the function for two outputs that require the same task and have a common owner. Example, don’t if both HR and finance need to calculate regular hours, don’t use the same function, as the CFO might want to change the definition of regular hours but HR doesn’t.\nOpen-Closed Principle (OCP): classes should be open for extension and closed for modification. (We should easily be able to add new functionality without having to change existing functionality.)\nUse names to make the context explicit (e.g. “for user in users” is explicit, “for i in list” isn’t).\nGet to proof of concept asap.\n“You ain’t gonna need it” (YAGNI). Don’t add functionality before it’s really necessary.\nNames Choose names that make clear what a thing is, what it does, and how it is used.\nUse plain and unabbreviated words.\nOmit needless words like “get” or “calculate”, but remember that “terseness and obscurity are the limits where brevity should stop”.\nUse verbs or verb phrases for functions, nouns for classes.\nChoose names of variables in proportion to their scope.\nWhenever appropriate, use names from the solution domain (e.g. computer or data science) or the problem domain (e.g. personal finance) otherwise.\nFunctions Functions should do one thing and one thing only and should do it well. (It’s not always obvious what “one thing” is, use your judgement.)\nMake functions as short as possible to make it obvious how they work and what they are for.\nMost often, blocks inside flow control statements should be one line long - calls to transparently named functions.\nA good function interface allows the user to do what they need without having to worry about unnecessary details. Hence: ask for the minimally required number of intuitive arguments and return the expected output.\nWrite pure functions. A function is pure when it is idempotent (returns the same output for a given input) and has no side-effects.\nComments and docstrings Don’t comment bad code – rewrite it.\nAdd docstrings to functions unless – following Google – they are helpers, short and obvious.\nModules Use the module.function idiom (i.e. use import module rather than from module import function) in all but the simplest projects.

This can be used to access module objects in the caller namespace as module.object.\nCalling from module import symbol imports symbol into the current namespace. However, the global namespace for symbol (if it’s a function) always remains the namespace in which it was defined, not the caller’s namespace.\nRegardless of what variant of the import statement is being used to import contents from a module, all of the module’s statements will be initialised the first time (and only the first time) the module name is encountered in an import statement (more details here).\nOne reason from module import * is generally discouraged is that it directly imports all the module’s objects into the caller’s namespace, which is often said to cluter it up. Especially when importing large modules this makes sense, as it’s much cleaner to keep objects defined in imported modules in eponymous namespaces and accessing them via module.object, which immediately makes clear where object comes from and can help greatly with debugging.\nOne implication of all the above is that as a developer, you don’t have to worry about clashing variable names between modules, as they are each stored in their own namespace, and accessed via moduleA.foo and moduleB.foo in the caller namespace.\nWhen we import a module foo, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module and, if none is found, searches a list of directories given the variable sys.path. sys.path contains the directory of the input script, the variable PYTHONPATH, and installation-dependent defaults. I can manipulate sys.path using standard list operations; to add a directory, use sys.path.append(\u0026#39;dirname\u0026#39;).\nA common usecase of the above for me is to make a package available to Jupyter Notebooks. By default, a notebook’s sys.path contains the folder the noteook is located in and a bunch of conda managed directories linked to my running Conda environment. To make available a package that lives in the project root directory, just do sys.path.append(\u0026#39;/Users/fgu/dev/projectname/packagename\u0026#39;). I can then reference modules from the package using from packagename import module.\nUse dir(modulename) to list all names defined in modulname, or dir() to list all names that are currently defined.\nRunning a module as a script For relative imports to work as described, for instance, here and in Chapter 8 in Python Essential References and in recipees 10.1 and 10.3 in the Python Cookbook, the file into which you import has itself to be a module rather than a top-level script. If it’s the latter, it’s name will be main and it won’t be considered part of a package, regardless of where on the file system it is saved. Generally, for a file to be considered part of a package, it needs to nave a dot (.) in its name, as in package.submodule.modulename.\nTo import modules into a main script, one (somewhat unideal) solution is to add the absolute path to the package to sys.path.\nPackages Packages are collections of modules. They help structure Python’s module namespace by using dotted module names. E.g. a.b refers to submodule b in package a. Thus, just as the use of modules alleviates worries about clashing global variable names between modules, using a package alleviates worries about clashing module between multi-module packages.

Search inside manual works as in vim. Basics A process is a running instance of a program. Everything is a fiele (the keyboard is read-only, the screen write only) Misc. useful stuff I use often ln -s [OPTIONS] FILE LINK. Create a soft link for FILE at LINK. If you use . for LINK, a link with the same name as FILE will be created in the current location.\nIn mac terminal, pbcopy and pbpaste allow you to copy from and paste to the terminal. I often use pwd | pbcopy to get a directory path for use elsewhere, and pbpaste \u0026gt; .gitignore to create a gitignore file from a template (e.g. from gitignore.io).\nRenaming multiple files: rename \u0026#39;s/\u0026lt;pattern to replace\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;new pattern\u0026gt;\u0026#39; [files]. For example, to replace foo with bar in all Python files, use rename \u0026#39;s/foo/bar/\u0026#39; *.py. Notice that the string command passed is a vim substitution pattern.\nFile handling file lists file type of all files in a directory. wc returns the number of words, lines, and bytes of the input file. Options -w, -l, -c return any one of those counts, -m returns the number of characters. (Remember difference between wc -w \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt; and wc -w \u0026lt; \u0026lt;filename\u0026gt;: former prints file name, latter redirects file content to command anonymously, so prints result only.) cut print certain columns of input file. sed (stream edit) offers vim-like search and replace on data. uniq removes duplicates from data. egrep for regex-based filtering. Processes top to list most memory-intensive processes. ps lists processes running in current terminal, use -aux option to print all running processes (use | grep to filter output). kill [signal] \u0026lt;process id\u0026gt; to kill a process, use -9 signal to force if required. ctrl-z to move current job to background, jobs to list running background jobs, fg \u0026lt;job id\u0026gt; to move job to foreground. Bash scripting Variables\n\u0026#39; interpret all content literally, \u0026#34; allow for variable substitution. $( command ) saves command output into a variable. export var makes var available to child process. /dev/stdin reads input from pipe. Arithmetic\nlet assigns result of expression to a variable. expr prints result of expression. $(( expression )) returns the result of expression. ${#var} returns the length of var in characters. Functions\nfunction_name () { \u0026lt;commands\u0026gt; } is the basic format (there is also function function_name {, but I prefer this. Permissions Three actions: r (read), w (write), x (execute). Three types of users: owner or user (u), group (g), and others (o). (a) applies to all types. Permission info is 10 characters long: first character is file type (- for file, d for directory), the remaining ones are rwx permissions for owner, group, and others, with letter indicating permission on, hyphen indicating permission off. Changing persmission: chmod \u0026lt;user type\u0026gt;\u0026lt;add or remove\u0026gt;\u0026lt;permission type\u0026gt;. User type defaults to a. Example: chmod g+w adds write permission for group, chmod u-x removes execute permission for owner, chmod a+rwx grants all permission to everyone. chmod stands for change file mode bits. Shortcuts: Remember the following: Octal Binary 0 000 1 001 2 010 3 011 4 100 5 101 6 110 7 111 This is useful because we can use the binary numbers to refer to rwx and the Octal ones as shortcuts (e.g. 5 is r-x). Further using the order of users as ugo, and using one Octal shortcut for each user, we can quickly set permissions for all users (e.g. 753 is rwxr-x-wx).\nDirectory permissions: r means you can read content (e.g. do ls), w means you can write (e.g. create files or subdirectories), and x means you can enter (e.g. cd).\nShebang The shebang character sequence (#!) is used in the first line of a script to specify the interpreter that executes the commands in the script.\nThere are two options, well explained here (and also, a bit more elaborately, here: one is the specify the absoute path to the interpreter (#!/bin/zsh), the other is to use the env utility to search for the specified interpreter in all directories in the $PATH variable and use the first occurrence that is found (#!/usr/bin/env zsh).\nThe second option trades security for portability and is what most people seem to recommend. So this is what I use.\nSources Ryan’s bash-scripting tutorial Ryan’s linux tutorial ","date":1605916800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605916800,"objectID":"b92856abe38b1e5c1173e9e1ee6fd82c","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/linux/","publishdate":"2020-11-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/linux/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["tools","cheatsheet"],"title":"Linux","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1604361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604361600,"objectID":"46da2ce357f0859d1c05618606fd3c04","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/idiomatic-python/","publishdate":"2020-11-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/idiomatic-python/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["python"],"title":"Idiomatic Python","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1601856000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601856000,"objectID":"5a92b24c81adf298cdf3032684dd70cd","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/python-functions/","publishdate":"2020-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/python-functions/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["python"],"title":"Python functions","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1601424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601424000,"objectID":"4e1c951ad6d7d1e1f8b4ced4c84f0c8a","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/documenting-sample-selection/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/documenting-sample-selection/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["datascience"],"title":"Documenting sample selection","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1601424000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601424000,"objectID":"b7ab1b731872a295d15e042f7d9bae34","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/python-decorators/","publishdate":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/python-decorators/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["python"],"title":"Python decorators","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1596412800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596412800,"objectID":"73b2908d8f9ee53186167abb9f68b547","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/matplotlib/","publishdate":"2020-08-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/matplotlib/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["dataviz"],"title":"Matplotlib","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"6f79e28f7a052081272b8b4b99fb87b4","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/machine-learning-basics/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/machine-learning-basics/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["stats"],"title":"Machine learning basics","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1584835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584835200,"objectID":"67c97026ded7b8d1b5b699dcb618a58e","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/python-built-in-heroes/","publishdate":"2020-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/python-built-in-heroes/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["python"],"title":"Python built-in heroes","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1578960000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578960000,"objectID":"5588d9a0d6a53dae6698d911bb95c735","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/paradox/","publishdate":"2020-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/paradox/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["datascience"],"title":"The waiting time paradox","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1574467200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574467200,"objectID":"f301af679e4a076c5bac2ef37234f13f","permalink":"https://fabiangunzinger.github.io/post/naive-bayes/","publishdate":"2019-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/naive-bayes/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["stats"],"title":"Naive Bayes","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Swiss History\nNext\nhttps://crookedtimber.org/2014/08/26/the-world-is-squared-episode-1-switzerland-country-of-joyce/ Matt Yglesias on why Switzerland works so well Scott Sumner: Switzerland’s secret sauce Archiv Solothurn (Gunzinger Stammforschung) Solothurnergeschichte CH book from Stauffacher Bern (good selection) Schweizer Geschichte\n‘4 Sprachen, 4 Kulturen, 26 Kantone, Einheit in der Vielfalt.

Bern und Fribourg wollen unabhängig bleiben. Eidgenossen kommen den sich in Murten verschanzenden Bernern zu Hilfe, schlagen die über 20,000 Mann starke Armee der gefürchteten Burgunder vernichtend. Eidgenossen erbeuten Burgunder-Schatz Stanser Verkomniss 1481 Stadtkantone (Bern, Zürich, Luzern) und Landkantone (Waldstätte, Zug, Glarus) streiten vordergründig um die Verteilung des Burgunderschatzes (Stadtkantone wollen Aufteilung proportional zur Anzahl beigesteuerter Truppen in der Schacht von Murten, Landkantone wollen Aufteilung zu gleichen Teilen) und tiefgründig um die Machtverteilung in der Eidgenossenschaft, welche die Stadkantone an sich reissen wollen (mittels Sonderbündnis, und mittels Aufnahme von Solothurn und Fribourg). Es droht der Zerfall der Eidgenossenschaft Auf unbekannten Rat von Niklaus von Flüe hin setzen sich die Ratsherren nochmals zusammen und einigen sich nach zwei Stunden. Abkommen: folgt Rat von Bruder Klaus. Kompromiss: Bern und Fribourg werden aufgenommen, kein Sonderbund der Stadtkantone. Tagsatzung Ab der Aufnahme Appenzells ist die Eidgenossenschaft ab 1513 ein Bund aus 13 Orten. An der Tagsatzung treffen sich die Gesandten der Orte zur Besprechung und Entscheiden gemeinsamer politischer Geschäfte. Im Dreissigjährigen Krieg 1618 – 1648 beschliesst die Tagsatzung ihre Neutralität gegenüber den beiden Konfessionen. Völkerrechtliche Souveränität Der Westfällische Frieden (von Münster) besiegelt 1648 den Dreissigjährigen Krieg und gewährt der Eidgenossenschaft (und Holland) die Unabhängigkeit vom Heiligen Römischen Reich und somit erstmals die völkerrechtliche Souveränität. Bis sich die Eidgenossenschaft als unabhängigen und souveränen Staat versteht dauert es allerdings weitere 150 Jahre. Solddienst Zwischen 1500 und 1850 dienen rund 1.5 Millionen Schweizer als Söldner: Für Frankreich, Venedig, die Niederlande, den Vatikan (Gründung der Schweizer Garde in 1506 durch Papst Julius II) Allianz mit Frankreich Frankreich ist seit dem 15. Jahrhundert ein wichtiger Allianzpartner, mit welchem Friedensvereinbarungen, Söldnerabkommen und Handelsabkommen geschlossen werden. Abschluss eines Vertrags auf ‘Ewigen Frieden’ in 1416 nach der von Frankreich gewonnenen Schlacht von Marignano (Eidgenossenschaft tritt Mailand an Italien ab, bahält Tessin). Die Franzosen profitieren vom Zugang zu Söldnern, die Eidgenossen von Freiem Handeln, Sicherheit von Händlern und Güter, Schutz vor willkürlichen Abgaben, und Zollreduktionen. 1777 wird die Allianz mit Frankreich in der St. Ursen Kirche in Solothurn nochmals feierlich erneuert. Reformation Humanismus Meint Abkehr von mittelalterlicher Theologie und Hinwendung zum Menschen. Helvetische Republik (1798) Die Helvetische Revolution von 1798 beseitigt die aristokratischen Privilegien aus dem Ancien Régime. Zum ersten Mal werden ein Parlament und eine Landesregierung gewählt. Prinzipien: Rechtsgleichheit, Volkssouveränität, Gewaltentrennung. Neutralität wird aufgegeben als Preis für die Unterstützung aus Frankreich, nimmt von 1798 bis 1802 gar Französische Besatzung in Kauf. Sonderbund Nach der 1830er Revolution in Paris bilden sich in vielen Kantonen Volksbewegungen gegen die Aristokratie und für mehr Demokratie und die Gewaltentrennung. Ein Vorstoss zur Grundlegenden Erneuerung des Bundes spaltet die Kantone. 1845 stellen sich Luzern, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, Freiburg, Wallis mit einem Sonderbund gegen diese liberalen Absichten (Gegründet 1845 im Rössli in Ruswil).
